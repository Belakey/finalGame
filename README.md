# finalGame
This game is a text based adventure game that starts either in a forest (easy start) or in the castle (tougher start)
You are a knight that goes through a storyline of traveling. You start by waking up not knowing where you are or how you got there and explore until you find something valuable.

This game features classes, adventure, choices, difficulties


New things I learned from doing this were how to open another form from a form, learned more about randomness as well as loops and debugging, I also learned about the resources file and how to add images/music
